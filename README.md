# School District Analysis
PyCity Schools Data Analysis Utilizing Python/Jupyter/Pandas

## Overview

The PyCity School District intially asked "the Team" to analyse school and student performance data for directors, board members and stakeholders to annually review. The
first iteration focused on key student metrics for the 15 schools in the district: math and reading scores, their averages, passing percentages in both subjects and
overall passing percentage. This data was then sorted and presented into formats for review by individual school, school type, school spending per student and school
size.

It was during this first assessment that a concern was raised regarding Thomas High School and 9th Grade student data possibly being erronious. "The Team" was then 
asked to remove the data for this school and grade level, and recompute a new analysis for comparison. This analysis focuses on this data removal and its effect on
the district's reporting.
